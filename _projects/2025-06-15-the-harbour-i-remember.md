In January 2024, I finally wrapped up a long-standing mountaineering obsession: the Seven Summits, which invovled climbing the tallest mountain on every continent, including Mount Everest. Vinson Massif in Antarctica was the final peak and certainly an unforgettable trip that ended the entire journey.

I’ve been filming my expeditions ever since my very first summit on Mount Kilimanjaro back in 2016. To mark the completion of the Seven Summits, I returned home and, without taking any sensible amount of rest, began working on a travel video that recaps the entire adventure.

Drawing on everything I’ve learned over the years of producing travel videos, I made a deliberate stylistic choice. Even though this felt to me like a fairly grand and monumental adventure, I didn’t want the film to feel overly dramatic filled with cliché cinematic background music.

Inspired by the trekking videos of creators like Kraig Adams, I aimed to present the climb in a more quiet and reflective manner. Despite how physically demanding it was, I wanted the audience to experience the same sense of awe and stillness I felt on the mountain.

To that end, I avoided flashy match cuts, elaborate transitions, and heavy-handed music. The edit is intentionally restrained and designed to make it feel less like you’re watching a video and more like you’re simply there, climbing alongside the people on screen.

I also considered removing narration altogether and not speaking directly to the camera. Partly to deepen immersion, and partly because I am, frankly, terrible at speaking on camera. In the end, I settled on a middle ground, balancing between cinematic footage and light on-screen narration, giving the film just enough structure without getting in its own way.
