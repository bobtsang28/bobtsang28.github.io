Having lived in Hong Kong on and off for over 40 years, Martin Lever's time in the city led him to make the shift from advertising to becoming an award-winning abstract and pop artist. Now back in the UK with his family, he’s focused on growing his art and expanding his business.

I met Martin while videographing an art exhibition at my university, where he was showing a selection of his work from Hong Kong. It didn’t take long for me to learn just how much of his life he had spent there, or how deeply the city’s culture had shaped his practice. I was immediately captivated. A couple of months later, I reached out to ask if he might be interested in being part of the project.

From our very first conversations, it was clear that the idea of memory would play a central role in the video. Given how deeply his life in Hong Kong is woven into his work, even today, the film was shaped to make the audience feel as though they are peering through a picture frame, into Martin’s memories as he reflects on his upbringing in the city.

As a result, the camera work was deliberately restrained to create a more observational style. This was complemented by a warm-hued colour grade and a 4:3 aspect ratio, emphasising a sense of nostalgia and Martin’s feelings toward Hong Kong’s shifting social and political landscape over the years. The sound design further supports this, with occasional ambient street sounds from Hong Kong woven throughout, alongside subtle retro sound effects.
