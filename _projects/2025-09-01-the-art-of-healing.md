Maki moved to the UK over 20 years ago, looking to experience a new culture. It is there that she discovered a love for pottery and studied under her late mentor, studio potter David White. She eventually settled in Yorkshire, where she opened her own studio. Now, she not only sells her work but also runs workshops that focus on healing and self-care.

I first came across Maki online, but it wasn’t until I spoke with her that I truly understood how inspiring her story is. While most articles and interviews have focused on her work and the workshops she offers at her studio in Knaresborough, few have explored her past or the motivations that shaped the direction of her art.

Her story is not an easy one to approach. Maki experienced a deeply traumatic childhood, the effects of which persisted into her young adulthood. However, as I learnt more about her journey, I found myself connecting with her pursuit of self-worth and confidence. Through her passion for pottery, she was able to confront her past, transforming it not only into a source of positive energy but also into a way to support and inspire others.

Seeing the dedication Maki has poured into building her studio and the passion she has for it, it was clear that the space had to be an integral part of the film, even without being explicitly highlighted. The visual approach for this project reflects that, using more fluid handheld camera work than previous endeavours. The style attempts to allow the audience to feel as though they are in the studio with Maki, sharing a conversation and experiencing the space alongside her.
