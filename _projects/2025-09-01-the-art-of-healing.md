Maki moved to the UK over 20 years ago, looking to experience a new culture. It is there that she discovered a love for pottery and eventually studied under her late mentor, studio potter David White. She eventually settled in Yorkshire, where she opened her own studio. Now, she not only sells her work but also runs workshops that focus on healing and self-care.

I first discovered Maki online, but it wasn’t until I spoke with her that I fully appreciated how inspiring her story truly is. While most coverage highlights her work and the workshops she offers at her studio in Knaresborough, centred around mindfulness and healing, few truly delved into her past or the motivations that shaped the direction of her art.

It’s certainly a difficult subject to approach. Maki experienced a deeply traumatic childhood, the effects of which continued well into her young adulthood. Yet, the more I learned about her, the more I found myself relating to her journey of finding self-worth and confidence. After years of struggle, she was able to confront her past through her passion for pottery, transforming it not only into a source of positive energy but also into a way to support and inspire others.

Seeing the dedication Maki has poured into building her studio and the passion she has for it, it was clear that the space had to be an integral part of the film, even without being explicitly highlighted. The visual approach for this project reflects that, using more fluid handheld camera work than previous endeavours. The style attempts to allow the audience to feel as though they are in the studio with Maki, sharing a conversation and experiencing the space alongside her.
