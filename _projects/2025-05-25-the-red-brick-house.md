Milo is a young adult feeling lost in life. Having left home with his girlfriend years ago, he has grown distant from the rest of his family. When he learns that his estranged father has passed away, he returns to the now-abandoned family inn, the Red Brick House, hoping for some form of reconciliation.

At the inn, Milo embarks on a journey into the past, revisiting moments in his family’s history that shaped the present. From witnessing his parents’ first meeting to seeing his father reaching out to him in his final moments, Milo gradually gains a deeper understanding of his family’s past. Through these encounters, he begins to learn how to let go.

At its heart, the film is about the cycle of life and the importance of treasuring the time we have with our family.

For the final-year project of my university course, each student was invited to pitch a concept for a 15-minute short film. Out of dozens of proposals, mine was selected, allowing me to take on the role of director.

The concept of the film drew from a wide variety of inspirations. From story elements influenced by films like Mirai (2018, dir. Mamoru Hosoda) to its title, inspired by an antique shop near my home called the Red Brick House, the aim was to craft a bittersweet narrative exploring family and the complexities of those relationships.

The production spanned over seven months. Through our fundraising campaign, more than £2,500 was raised, yet, as a student project, there were still considerable limitations. I oversaw a broad range of creative and logistical responsibilities, guiding the film from initial concept to final delivery.
