Milo is a young adult feeling lost in life. Having left home with his girlfriend years ago, he has grown distant from the rest of his family. When he learns that his estranged father has passed away, he returns to the now-abandoned family inn, the Red Brick House, hoping for some form of reconciliation.

At the inn, Milo embarks on a journey into the past, revisiting moments in his family’s history that shaped the present. From witnessing his parents’ first meeting to seeing his father reaching out to him in his final moments, Milo gradually gains a deeper understanding of his family’s past. Through these encounters, he begins to learn how to let go.

At its heart, the film is about the cycle of life and the importance of treasuring the time we have with our family.

As the final-year project of my university course, each student was given the opportunity to pitch their own idea for a 15-minute short film. Out of dozens of proposals, I was fortunate to have mine selected and to take on the role of director.

The concept of the film drew from a wide range of inspirations. rom story elements influenced by films like Mirai (2018, dir. Mamoru Hosoda) to the title, which came from an antique shop called the Red Brick House near my home, I wanted to create a bittersweet story that explored family and the complexities of those relationships.

The production lasted over seven months. Through our fundraising campaign, we managed to raise more than £2,500, but as a student project, we still faced significant limitations. I was responsible for managing a wide range of creative and logistical responsibilities for the film from start to finish.
