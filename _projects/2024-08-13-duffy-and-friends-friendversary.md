In the summer of 2024, I was approached by the Chair of UWCGO Hong Kong, Elizabeth Fung, to lead the development of a promotional video for Li Po Chun United World College's fundraising project, "Vision 2052: Together Shaping the Next 30 Years of LPC." This transformative initiative aims to shape the future of UWC Hong Kong and empower generations of students to come. The investments are intended to serve as a cornerstone for enhancing the college’s ability to deliver an even stronger academic program, equipping students with the tools and knowledge to tackle the urgent challenges facing both our local and global communities.

Considering the limited budget and tight production timeline, I approached the project from a fairly mathematical perspective, holding multiple meetings with LPC board members to understand the logistical considerations before delving into narrative and story elements. Once I received a brief outlining the board’s goals, I crafted a treatment and style deck, and held further discussions in the weeks leading up to the shoot to refine the visual elements.

In the end, we focused on what makes LPC truly unique. Amidst a changing macro environment and with the future in mind, we agreed that the core value of a UWC education is its ability to inspire students to become, quite simply, good-natured people, an attribute no technology can replace, and one that is essential if we are to come together to address common challenges such as societal conflicts and climate change.

Considering the message, I chose to focus on the “people of LPC” as the central element of the video, highlighting their resilience and positivity in the face of challenges ahead. Accordingly, all visual and audio elements, including the soundtrack, were carefully selected and edited to reinforce this theme.
