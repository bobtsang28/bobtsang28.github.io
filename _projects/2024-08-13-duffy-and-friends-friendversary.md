As part of my internship at Disneyland Hong Kong as a broadcast marketing intern, I took on a variety of responsibilities, including producing social media shorts for the park’s annual Duffy and Friends Friendversary events, a celebration of the bond between the Duffy and Friends characters and the park’s guests.

Considering the limited budget and tight production timeline, I approached the project from a fairly mathematical perspective, holding multiple meetings with LPC board members to understand the logistical considerations before delving into narrative and story elements. Once I received a brief outlining the board’s goals, I crafted a treatment and style deck, and held further discussions in the weeks leading up to the shoot to refine the visual elements.

In the end, we focused on what makes LPC truly unique. Amidst a changing macro environment and with the future in mind, we agreed that the core value of a UWC education is its ability to inspire students to become, quite simply, good-natured people, an attribute no technology can replace, and one that is essential if we are to come together to address common challenges such as societal conflicts and climate change.

Considering the message, I chose to focus on the “people of LPC” as the central element of the video, highlighting their resilience and positivity in the face of challenges ahead. Accordingly, all visual and audio elements, including the soundtrack, were carefully selected and edited to reinforce this theme.
