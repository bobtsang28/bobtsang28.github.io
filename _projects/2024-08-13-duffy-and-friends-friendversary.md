As part of my internship at Disneyland Hong Kong as a broadcast marketing intern, I took on a variety of responsibilities, including producing social media shorts for the park’s annual Duffy and Friends Friendversary events, a celebration of the bond between the Duffy and Friends characters and the park’s guests.

Although this project was quite different from my previous work, I approached it in more or less the same way, starting with storyboarding and brainstorming ideas that would immediately capture the audience’s attention. Since these were social videos, my main focus was on audience retention, which relies heavily on visuals and editing. For the three videos I produced, I treated each one differently, experimenting with various transition styles. Whether they be a simple graphic match cut or picture-in-picture, my goal was to make each short feel fresh and distinct while maintaining a consistent overall tone.

Since these were Disneyland shorts, I not only had to follow Disney’s high editing standards and stylistic guidelines, but also highlight the guests’ enjoyment and their interactions with the characters. With multiple camera operators on each shoot, I planned ahead, identifying which parts of the day would best capture guest reactions and prioritising coverage based on the activities, whether it was the parade, a drawing session, or a photoshoot. Navigating Disney’s strict character guidelines alongside the tight event schedule was certainly challenging, but seeing the final footage made it all the more rewarding.
