In the summer of 2024, I was approached by Elizabeth Fung, Chair of UWCGO Hong Kong, to lead the development of a promotional video for Li Po Chun United World College’s fundraising initiative, "Vision 2052: Together Shaping the Next 30 Years of LPC." This initiative aims to shape the future of UWC Hong Kong, empowering generations of students to come. The investments are intended to strengthen the college’s academic programmes and equip students with the skills and knowledge needed to address pressing challenges both locally and globally.

With a constrained budget and a tight production schedule, the project required a structured and methodic approach. It began with a series of meetings with LPC board members to align on objectives, assess logistical requirements, and identify key priorities for the video. Once the board’s goals were clearly defined, a comprehensive treatment was developed to establish the narrative direction, visual language, and overall tone of the project. In the weeks leading up to the shoot, we continued to fine-tune the visual approach and ensure that every element of the production would effectively support the college’s messaging.

In the end, we focused on what makes LPC truly unique. Amidst a changing macro environment and with the future in mind, we agreed that the core value of a UWC education is its ability to inspire students to become, quite simply, good-natured people, an attribute no technology can replace, and one that is essential if we are to come together to address common challenges such as societal conflicts and climate change.

Considering the message, the “people of LPC” were placed at the heart of the video, showcasing their resilience and positivity in the face of future challenges. Every visual and audio element, including the soundtrack, was carefully selected and edited to reinforce this central theme.
