One of my passions is bikepacking! Over the years, I’ve found cycling to be one of the most exciting ways to explore countries like Japan. It’s at just the right pace where you move fast enough to cover ground, yet slow enough to truly take in your surroundings and discover hidden spots off the beaten path, something you rarely get to experience, even by car.

Having done quite a few bikepacking trips in Japan, I decided in the summer of 2024 to take on a solo adventure, riding 800km across Central Japan, a region close to my heart. Starting in Kyoto, the journey carried me from Japan’s historic capital to the remote prefecture of Fukui, a place I had long dreamed of visiting. Despite being one of the least populated and visited prefectures in the country, I’d seen glimpses of its stunning rural towns online and knew I had to experience them for myself.

The second half of the route took me on intense uphill trails through some of Japan’s most mountainous terrain. Despite the grueling climbs, it was certainly the highlight of the journey, exploring some of the most rural corners of the country I’ve ever seen and connecting with locals, hearing their stories and learning about life in these remote areas.

Shooting this film required an unprecedented level of pre-production, simply because it was a solo project. After planning a general route with a dozen waypoints, I also prepared several backup options in case I couldn’t reach my intended destination each day. With no pre-booked accommodation, I often had to search online, or even knock on doors, just to find a place to stay. Even though I had mapped out the structure and visuals of the video in advance, the daily unpredictability, combined with the need to capture a quota of footage to weave together a coherent narrative, made it one of the most logistically challenging projects I’ve ever undertaken.
