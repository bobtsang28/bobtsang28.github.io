In my final year of university, I wanted to try something beyond my coursework. Having previously worked on video content with the student television society, I made the decision to take on projects completely independently. That’s how my documentary series started, traveling to interesting places and interviewing fascinating people, hoping their stories would capture the interest of my friends and family around the world.

When I first started, I knew I wanted to interview the owners of some of my favorite restaurants in York, but Ippuku Tea House felt like too big a project to tackle at the time. So I initially focused on a few smaller independent businesses. After struggling to spark interest from several of the restaurants I had hoped to film, I decided to return to my original plan and reach out to Ippuku. It took weeks of back-and-forth emails, but in the end, not only did the owner, Frankie, agree to be interviewed, one of the chefs, Eden, who happened to be a film school graduate, offered to help with the project.

The second half of the route took me on intense uphill trails through some of Japan’s most mountainous terrain. Despite the grueling climbs, it was certainly the highlight of the journey, exploring some of the most rural corners of the country I’ve ever seen and connecting with locals, hearing their stories and learning about life in these remote areas.

Shooting this film required an unprecedented level of pre-production, simply because it was a solo project. After planning a general route with a dozen waypoints, I also prepared several backup options in case I couldn’t reach my intended destination each day. With no pre-booked accommodation, I often had to search online, or even knock on doors, just to find a place to stay. Even though I had mapped out the structure and visuals of the video in advance, the daily unpredictability, combined with the need to capture a quota of footage to weave together a coherent narrative, made it one of the most logistically challenging projects I’ve ever undertaken.
