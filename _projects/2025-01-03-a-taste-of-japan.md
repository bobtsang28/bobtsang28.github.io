In my final year of university, I wanted to try something beyond my coursework. Having previously worked on video content with the student television society, I made the decision to take on projects completely independently. That’s how my documentary series started, traveling to interesting places and interviewing fascinating people, hoping their stories would capture the interest of my friends and family around the world.

When I first started, I knew I wanted to interview the owners of some of my favorite restaurants in York, but Ippuku Tea House felt like too big a project to tackle at the time. So I initially focused on a few smaller independent businesses. After struggling to spark interest from several of the restaurants I had hoped to film, I decided to return to my original plan and reach out to Ippuku. It took weeks of back-and-forth emails, but in the end, not only did the owner, Frankie, agree to be interviewed, one of the chefs, Eden, who happened to be a film school graduate, offered to help with the project.

In recent years, Japanese cuisine has become increasingly popular, but finding an authentic Japanese restaurant in the UK can still be a challenge. Hearing Frankie share her personal journey with her husband, from selling Japanese tea online to opening a tea house in the heart of York, was truly inspiring. Although COVID had a significant impact on their business, Frankie remains hopeful that they will bounce back in the near future.

This video has gathered over 1,400 views on YouTube. Navigating all the behind-the-scenes logistics was definitely a challenge, but getting an inside look at how a Japanese tea house operates and meeting the people who bring it to life immediately made me want to create more of these types of videos.
