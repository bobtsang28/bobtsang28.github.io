While awareness of accessibility in film and television has grown in recent years, it remains an area where the industry still has significant gaps. The Enhancing Audio Description project explores how sound design and spatial audio can create more inclusive experiences for visually impaired audiences. The project expands the concept of media accessibility and enhances both the quality and availability of audio description services, offering cutting-edge techniques to the UK cultural sector.

I first came across Maki online, but it wasn’t until I spoke with her that I truly understood how inspiring her story is. While most articles and interviews have focused on her work and the workshops she offers at her studio in Knaresborough, few have explored her past or the motivations that shaped the direction of her art.

Her story is not an easy one to approach. Maki experienced a deeply traumatic childhood, the effects of which persisted into her young adulthood. However, as I learnt more about her journey, I found myself connecting with her pursuit of self-worth and confidence. Through her passion for pottery, she was able to confront her past, transforming it not only into a source of positive energy but also into a way to support and inspire others.

Seeing the dedication Maki has poured into building her studio and the passion she has for it, it was clear that the space had to be an integral part of the film, even without being explicitly highlighted. The visual approach for this project reflects that, using more fluid handheld camera work than previous endeavours. The style attempts to allow the audience to feel as though they are in the studio with Maki, sharing a conversation and experiencing the space alongside her.
