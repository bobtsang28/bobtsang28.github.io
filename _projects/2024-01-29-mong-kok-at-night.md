Perhaps one of the most recognisable iconographies of Hong Kong is that of cage homes and, by extension, the Kowloon Walled City. Type “Hong Kong” online and you’ll find an abundance of content dedicated to romanticising this once lawless neighbourhood.

It wasn’t until I had lived abroad that I began to realise how many people’s impressions of the city lean toward this dystopian, cyberpunk vision.

Having spent the summer of 2023 back in Hong Kong, I made a conscious effort to see the city from an outsider’s perspective, asking myself what someone who had never visited might think of it. It proved to be a surprisingly eye-opening experience. I not only found myself enjoying the city more than I had in years, but also realised just how much I had previously taken for granted.

One evening after work, I grabbed my camera and headed out for a night shoot in Mong Kok, one of Hong Kong’s busiest districts and one synonymous with the neon glow the city is known for. I didn't really have a plan; I simply wandered for hours, filming places I remembered fondly from my childhood. What I didn’t expect was how strongly it would stir my memories.

In post-production, I experimented with different colour grades, searching for a balance that could nod to Mong Kok’s cyberpunk atmosphere without tipping into a stereotypical, tourist-eye rendition of the city. That same thinking led me to choose an instrumental cover of a well-known nostalgic Cantopop song instead of an electronic synth track, giving the film the feel of being set in the early 2000s.

In the months following the release of the video, many more of the neon lights in the area have been taken down. With new regulations in place, this once-celebrated city tradition has all but disappeared. It’s heartbreaking to see, myself included, but I’m grateful to have captured this iconic aspect of the city on film before it disappeared. To me, it serves as a lasting memory of my years living in this incredible place.
